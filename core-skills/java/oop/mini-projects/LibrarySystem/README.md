# Mini-Project: Library System

This project demonstrates OOP concepts in a practical context:
- Classes: Book, User, LibrarySystem
- Relationships: Users borrow/return books
- Methods and state management

## Ideas to extend:
- Add book search
- Track due dates
- Add admin/librarian roles
- Persist data to file or database
