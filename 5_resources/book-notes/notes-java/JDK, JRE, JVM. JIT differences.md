# Differences Between JDK, JRE, JVM, and JIT

## **JDK (Java Development Kit)**
- The **JDK** provides development tools and a runtime environment (JRE). The JDK contains the compiler and the JVM.

- Using JDK software, we can develop, compile, and execute new applications, and also, if required, modify existing applications.


## **JRE (Java Runtime Environment)**
- The **JRE** provides only the runtime environment; it does not provide any development tools. It allows modifying only already developed applications; we cannot develop new applications.


## **JVM (Java Virtual Machine)**
- The **JVM** is a platform that provides an interpreter for executing Java bytecode by converting it into the current OS machine language.


## **JIT (Just-In-Time Compiler)**
- The **JIT** is responsible for helping the interpreter execute Java bytecode quickly. Basically, the JIT improves the performance of Java program execution, providing high performance.
