## Topic: Java Fundamentals

Today I wrote my very first Java program! I learned about the structure of a Java class, the main method, and how to print output to the console using `System.out.println`. I also practiced compiling and running Java code from the terminal. This was a great introduction to the language and set the foundation for more advanced topics.

**Key takeaways:**
- Java syntax basics
- How to run a Java program
- The importance of the main method
