## Topic: Java Mini Project

Today I built a mini Java project called `JavaLearningApp` that brings together everything I have learned so far: fundamentals, data structures, concurrency, and JVM concepts. The app simulates a user completing different Java topics using threads and tracks progress with data structures. This project helped me see how all the concepts fit together in a real application.

**Key takeaways:**
- Integrating multiple Java concepts in one project
- Using threads and data structures together
- Building confidence to tackle more advanced Java topics
