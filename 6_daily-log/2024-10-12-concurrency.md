I practiced starting and joining threads, and saw how multiple threads can run in parallel. Understanding thread safety and synchronization is crucial for writing robust concurrent programs.

**Key takeaways:**
- How to create and start threads
- The difference between Runnable and Thread
- Thread lifecycle and joining
