## Topic: JVM Internals

Today I studied the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and its role in running Java programs. I learned the differences between the JDK, JRE, and JVM, and how Java code is compiled to bytecode and executed by the JVM. I also explored the basics of garbage collection and memory management in Java.

**Key takeaways:**
- JVM, JDK, and JRE differences
- How Java code is executed
- Basics of garbage collection
