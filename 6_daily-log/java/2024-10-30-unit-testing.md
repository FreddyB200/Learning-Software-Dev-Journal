## Topic: Unit Testing with JUnit

Today I learned about unit testing in Java using JUnit. I wrote simple test methods to check if my code works as expected. Writing tests helps me catch bugs early and gives me confidence to refactor code. I also learned about assertions and how to organize test cases.

**Key takeaways:**
- Writing and running JUnit tests
- Using assertions to check results
- The importance of automated testing
