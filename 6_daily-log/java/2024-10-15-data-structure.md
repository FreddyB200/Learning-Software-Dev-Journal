## Topic: Java Data Structures

Today I learned about basic data structures in Java: arrays, ArrayList, and HashMap. I practiced declaring, initializing, and iterating over these structures. I also learned how to add, remove, and access elements. These are essential tools for organizing and managing data in any Java application.

**Key takeaways:**
- Arrays, ArrayList, and HashMap usage
- Basic operations: add, remove, access, iterate
- When to use each data structure
