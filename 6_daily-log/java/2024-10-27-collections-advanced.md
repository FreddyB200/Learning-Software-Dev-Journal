## Topic: Advanced Java Collections

Today I explored advanced features of the Java Collections Framework. I learned how to use utility methods from the Collections class, such as shuffle and sort, and how to work with Sets and Maps. I also practiced iterating over collections and understanding their unique properties.

**Key takeaways:**
- Collections utility methods (shuffle, sort)
- Using List, Set, and Map
- Iterating and working with unique elements
