## Topic: Java Generics

Today I learned about Java Generics. I practiced creating generic classes and methods to write reusable and type-safe code. Generics help prevent runtime errors by catching type issues at compile time. I also saw how to use generics with different types, like String and Integer.

**Key takeaways:**
- How to define and use generic classes
- Type safety and code reuse
- Generics with different data types
