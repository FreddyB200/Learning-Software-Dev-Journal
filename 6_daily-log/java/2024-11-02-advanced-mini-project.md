## Topic: Java Advanced Mini Project

Today I built a new mini project called `JavaAdvancedLearningApp` that brings together all the advanced topics I have learned: generics, exception handling, lambda expressions, advanced collections, and unit testing (conceptual). This project helped me see how these features work together in a real-world scenario and improved my confidence in using modern Java.

**Key takeaways:**
- Integrating advanced Java concepts in one project
- Applying generics, lambdas, and exception handling
- Building more robust and maintainable code
